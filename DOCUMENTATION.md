## 1. Architectural Approaches Investigated

Our research was structured as a comparative study between optimizing a standard SegFormer architecture and implementing a specific architectural variant.

### 1.1 Standard SegFormer with Training Optimizations

The standard SegFormer architecture (`nvidia/mit-b5`) serves as the foundation. Its key characteristic is a lightweight MLP decoder that outputs logits at a reduced resolution (e.g., H/4 x W/4). Our investigation focused on two primary optimization strategies applied to this standard model:

1.  **Class Weighting**: Applying a `WeightedCrossEntropyLoss` to counteract the class imbalance inherent in the TCD dataset. Weights are calculated based on inverse class frequency. This is controlled by the `--class_weights_enabled` flag.
2.  **Full-Resolution Loss Supervision**: By default, loss is calculated on the H/4 logits. This strategy involves upsampling these low-resolution logits to the full input resolution (H x W) *externally* before the loss calculation. This forces the model to learn from high-frequency details without any internal architectural changes. This is controlled by the `--apply_loss_at_original_resolution` flag.

Our findings show that the combination of these two strategies yields the best performance.

### 1.2 The `TrueResSegformer` Architectural Variant

As a direct point of comparison, we designed and tested `TrueResSegformer`. This variant modifies the standard SegFormer decoder head.

-   **Mechanism**: Instead of outputting low-resolution logits, it takes the H/4 x W/4 logits from the decoder, applies an **internal bilinear interpolation** layer to upsample them to the full H x W resolution, and only then computes the loss and final prediction.
-   **Hypothesis**: The initial hypothesis was that this internal, pre-activation upsampling would better preserve feature-rich details and lead to superior boundary delineation.
-   **Activation**: This architecture is enabled using the `--use_true_res_segformer` flag.

### 1.3 OAM-TCD Dataset

All experiments were conducted on the OpenAerialMap Tree Crown Delineation (OAM-TCD) dataset, which features high-resolution aerial imagery for a binary tree crown segmentation task.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Data Processing & Augmentation

The pipeline in `dataset.py` handles loading the `restor/tcd` dataset from Hugging Face Hub, preprocessing images (normalization, RGB conversion), and applying a suite of augmentations (random crops, flips, rotations, color jitter) to the training set to ensure robustness.

### 2.2 Training Pipeline for Comparison

The `pipeline.py` module orchestrates the entire experimental workflow. It is designed to be agnostic to the model configuration, allowing for seamless comparison between standard SegFormer and `TrueResSegformer` variants by interpreting settings from the `Config` object. It manages the training loop, validation, metric calculation, and checkpointing for any given experimental run.

### 2.3 Key Optimization Techniques

To ensure fair and robust training, several optimization techniques are consistently applied across all experiments:

-   **Mixed Precision Training**: Reduces memory usage and accelerates training on compatible hardware.
-   **Gradient Accumulation**: Enables training with larger effective batch sizes than memory would otherwise allow.
-   **Learning Rate Scheduling**: A cosine annealing scheduler with warmup is used for stable convergence.

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

Our evaluation, implemented in `metrics.py`, focuses on a comprehensive set of metrics:
-   **Standard Metrics**: IoU, F1-Score, Pixel Accuracy, Precision, and Recall for the 'Tree Crown' class.
-   **Boundary-Specific Metric**: **Boundary IoU (B-IoU)** is used as the primary metric for assessing the quality of fine-grained boundary delineation, which is crucial for TCD.

## 3. Code Structure

### 3.1 Core Modules

The codebase is organized for clarity and reproducibility:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pipeline.py` | Centralized training and evaluation pipeline for all model variants. |
| `model.py` | Implementations for SegFormer and the `TrueResSegformer` variant. |
| `config.py` | Centralized configuration management with validation. |
| `dataset.py` | OAM-TCD dataset loading and processing. |
| `metrics.py` | Comprehensive evaluation metrics including Boundary IoU. |
| `weights.py` | Class weight computation for imbalanced datasets. |
| `visualization.py` | Visualization tools for generating plots and comparative analysis. |
| `main.py` | Command-line interface for running all experiments. |
| `exceptions.py` | Custom exception hierarchy for robust error handling. |


### 3.2 Configuration Management

All experimental parameters are managed by the `Config` class in `config.py`. This allows for experiments to be defined and reproduced via a single JSON file or command-line arguments, ensuring consistency across runs.

## 4. Research Background & Development

### 4.1 Research Motivation & Hypothesis

The research was motivated by the challenge of achieving precise boundary delineation in TCD tasks with standard Vision Transformer models like SegFormer. The initial hypothesis was that the standard low-resolution output of SegFormer was a primary bottleneck and that an architectural modification forcing internal full-resolution processing (`TrueResSegformer`) would yield superior results.

### 4.2 Key Empirical Findings

Our systematic experiments led to a more nuanced understanding that challenged our initial hypothesis:

1.  **The Training Strategy is Paramount**: We found that applying full-resolution loss supervision *externally* to a standard SegFormer was a more effective strategy for improving boundary metrics than our internal `TrueResSegformer` modification.
2.  **Synergistic Effects**: The best performance was not achieved by a single change, but by the combination of full-resolution loss and class weighting applied to the standard SegFormer architecture.
3.  **A Clear Performance Hierarchy**: The results established a clear hierarchy, with the optimized standard SegFormer (B-IoU 0.6201) outperforming the `TrueResSegformer` variant (B-IoU 0.5892) under identical conditions (with class weights).

This journey of discovery underscores the paper's main conclusion: methodical optimization of training strategies can be more impactful than isolated architectural changes.

## 5. Usage Patterns

### 5.1 Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `main.py` script provides a powerful CLI to run any experiment from the paper. Different configurations are controlled via flags. See the `README.md` for detailed examples.

### 5.2 Python API

Key functions like `run_training_pipeline` in `pipeline.py` can be imported and used programmatically, allowing for integration into larger workflows or for custom experimentation, as demonstrated in the `README.md`.
